# CraigsCSharpX10Project

This is a really old project that I worked on in 2003 when C# was still a new protocol.  It is not maintained as of today and have not kept up with latest standards as even my smarthome has moved away from X-10 products (Mostly). 

It has not been updated in years so may or may not be of interest to anyone but since only SCM like github are now stable it seemed like it was finally time to move this from a zip file on my website to something more modern.
